## Chapter 7 - Bets, Not Backlogs

Thanks to no sh\*t sherlock holmes who wrote this document, its evident that backlogs are not good for business. Backlogs are a big weight that don't need to be carried, and a growing pile of backlog leads to a feeling of always being behind.

Instead of backlogs, use a "betting table" before each six week cycle. The stakeholders decide what to work on by reviewing pitches from the last six weeks. There are just a few small-shaped, risk-reduced options to review. The pitches are potential bets.

## Chapter 8 - The Betting Table

### Six-Week Cycles

- a cycle provides a standard project size for shaping and scheduling
- argues that two weeks cycles are too short
- last two weeks are "cool-down"

### The Betting Table

- held during cool-down phase where stakeholders decide the projects for the next cycle
- potential bets are either new pitches shaped during the last cycle or older pitches that someone has revived

### The Meaning of a Bet

- bets are from different plans, setting different expectations
- bets are commitments, get the whole cycle without interruptions
- bets have a cap on downside, the max loss is six weeks

### Uninterrupted Time

- essential to honor bet and now allow team to be interrupted

### The Circuit Breaker

- ensures that if a team doesn not finish their work within the cycle (the bet), the project doens't automatically get an extension. This is to prevent runaway projects and to ensure that one project doesn't monopolize resources

### What About Bugs?

- bugs do not interrupt teams during their six-week cycle

### Keep the Slate Clean

- key to managing capacity is to start fresh with every cycle. This ensures there's no carryover (backlog).

## Chapter 9 - Place Your Bets

It is important to reflect on the current stage of the product - there are different expectations depending on the stage.

There are three modes for new products

### R&D Mode

- exploration
  - features might be started then discarded if it doens't fit the vision
- goal is to learn what works by building it

### Production Mode

- the product will have its foundational features
- shaping is deliberate
- the goal is to ship

### Cleanup Mode

- no specific shaping or betting, time is allocated ot fix whatever is needed before launch
