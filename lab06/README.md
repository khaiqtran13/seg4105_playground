Workout Generation is broken down into 5-main components (scope)

1. Endpoints
2. Data Collection
3. Algorithm
4. UI
5. Survey

The main features of Data Collection include:

- Question Design

  - how questions will be phrased with clarity
  - how questions will cater to different fitness levels and goals

- Data Validation

  - ensure collected data is valid and consistent

- Data Processing

  - translating survey data into data that the workout generation algorithm can use
  - ensuring processing is efficient and error-free
