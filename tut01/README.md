# Brainstorm

- There are many different types of project management
  - a few variants have overlap and others are different
- It is important to choose the proper type of PM for each project
- The PM variant being used should be understood by everyone and needs to be very structured

The blogpost should briefly outline different types of PM variants to inform users of which ones would best suit their project. It shouldn't go too in-depth, instead it should be surface level knowledge such that the reader can deep dive themselves at a later point.
