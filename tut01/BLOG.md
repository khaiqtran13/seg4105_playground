# The PM Playbook: Choosing the Right Methodolog

### Waterfall Project Management

This approach is structured and sequential and is best suited for projects where the scope and requirements are well understood at the beginning. The project is divided into phases and the next phase cannot beging until the prior one is complete.

It is not ideal for projects that require frequent modifications along the way or projects that have overlapped timelines.

### Agile Project Management

This approach is iterative which embraces change and flexibility. The project is broken down into small increments with minimal planning with tasks being short-term.

This style is ideal for projects that require frequent modification and is one of the most popular in software development. Agile development can be broken down into

1.  **Scrum**

    A framework within Agile which divides the project into time-boxed periods where defined tasks must be completed. Scrum invovles regular stand-ups and other meetings revolving reviewing and planning.

2.  **Kanban**

    ... emphasizes continuous delivery. In Kanban, tasks are visualized on a board which makes it easier to manage workflows and identify bottlenecks.

### Lean Project Management

a philosophy that is focused on increasing efficiency across processes. It focuses on delivering value to the customer by clearly defining the customer's value by eliminating actions or processes that do not add value.

### Six Sigma Project Management

a data-driven methodology focused on identifying the needs of customers and eliminating unneeded processes to continuously improve processes to deliver a high-quality product.

The five phases of **DMAIC** are:

1. define the project
2. measure data
3. analyze the root of any problem
4. improve processes
5. control by implementing solutions

### PRINCE2 Project Management

a process-oriented method that provides a detail, step-by-step appraoch for managing projects. It focuses on organization and structure through the project's life span. The project must have a business justification, detailed cost assesment and baseline requirement before being initaited. The team member's roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, and the project is broken down into phases.

# Conclusion

Unfotunately when it comes to project management, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. The right project management methodology depends on various factors like project type, timeline, scope and team dynamics. Each methodology has its strengths and weaknesses and understanding these and their differences will help match your project to the best suitable methodology. The understanding of the variants of PM is the key to finding alignment.
