## Chapter 2

There are two separate tracks, one for shaping and one for building

### Shaping

is kept private until a commitment is made to bet on it, this allows shapers to expore and drop ideas freely.

#### Steps

1. Set Boundaries: define the problem and decide how much time the idea is worth
2. Rough out the Elements: sketch a solution at a higher level of abstraction than wireframes to explore a wide range of possibilities
3. Address Risks and Rabbit Holes: identify and address potential issues tat could trip up the team
4. Write the Pitch: once the idea is shaped enough, it is packaged as a pitch, which summarizes the problem, constraints, solution, and potential risks

#### Properties of Shaped Work

|         |                                                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Rough   | The work is not detail, it just provides a framework |
| Solved  | The main elements are concrete and connect together  |
| Bounded | The work sets specific boundaries                    |

The process of shaping is primarily design work, but requires technical literacy and strategic thinking as well

## Chapter 3

It is important to set boundaries on the goal. This helps guide the conversation and helps ensure everyone stays on the same scope and scale for the project.

### Importance of Problem Definition

The conversation to start building a feature begins with an idea, "customers are asking for group notifications. It is important to narrow the problem definition e.g "rethink the files section because sharing multiple files takes too many steps."

In the shaping process, setting clear boundaries as the first step helps focusing the discussion to ensure the project stays within scope.

## Chapter 4

There are two factors that are important when moving from idea to elements: having the right people in the room and avoiding unnecessary details in drawings and sketches.

### Importance of Level of Detail

It is not ideal to start with wireframes or specific visual details, a "fat marker approach" is more ideal to sketch out the main elements.

### Breadboarding

This technique invovles sketching the solution at a high level, focusing on the UI's functional elements without getting into the visual design. This gives a way to outline main components and user interactions without commit to a specific layout / design.

### Fat Market Sketches

These are rough visual sketches made with a thicc marker. It goal is to capture the essence ofa design without bogging down on the details.

In this stage, the work is still rough and is mostly an outline, but it has moved from an idea to an approach with concrete elements.

## Chapter 5

### Rabbit Holes

In a well-shaped work, elements of the solution are defined and familiar enough such that there should not be significant delays (but there can be a slight chance it can take a bit longer than expected).

If there exists any "rabbit holes" in shaping (e.g technical unknowns, unsolved design problems), the project can take significantly longer than planned.

The introduction of use case studies can help identify gaps or missing peices.

After addressing potential risks and rabbit holes, the idea is solidified and ready to be presented.
