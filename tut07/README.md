# Chapter 13: Show Progress

### Tasks that aren't there

- important to recognize and account for hidden tasks

### Estimates don't show uncertainty

- traditional estimates fail to capture all uncertainties

- compares work metaphorically to a hill

### Work is like a hill

tasks have two phases

- uphill: figuring out the approach and what to do
- downhill: phase of execution

uphill is filled with uncertainty while downhill is marked by certainty and confidence

### Status without asking

- mamanger prefer to see status of projects themselves rather than asking for updates

### Nobody says "IDK"

- team members can be reluctant to admit "IDK" when solving problems which lead to hidden uncertainties and risks.
- hillcharts can show if someone might be stuck on a task

### Solve in the right sequence

- use hillcharts to determine the sequence in which problems should be solved
- prioritize the most uncertain and challenging tasks first to ensure issues are addressed early in the project

Chapter 13 summarizes the approach to manage project progress and tasks, and focuses on the hill chart as a tool for visualizing and addressing the dynamics of projects.
